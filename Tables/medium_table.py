'''
Medium tables are second encounter before big and round tables. They require x1.35 of "lucky trail" score requirement
(e.g. lucky trail require 350 points, and medium table requires 475 points)
(side note: all non-integer values will be rounded in ceiling and will be divisible by 5. Here, 350*1.35 actually gives 472.5, but we're getting rid of 0.5 and we get 472, but we still need "nice numbers", so rounding up to 475)
