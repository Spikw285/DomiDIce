Before starting the run player can choose the way points are scored. By default it's set to [[Yahtzee]], where player scores by Yahtzee rules, and after fourth [stake](Stakes) player can apply [modified rules](Yahtzee+).
Player can have a bag of [dices](Dices.md) and can hold up to 7 [dominoes](Dominoes.md). Each domino has it's active and passive state depending on orientation, and each dice and domino has it's own [material](Materials) that can amplify some effects.
Player can throw up to 5 times per [table](Tables) (until player can increase it's amount or it's decreased via round table debuff), and reroll up to 3 times per table (until player can increase it's amount or it's decreased via round table debuff). Each roll can be rerolled to make other combinations and player can choose which dices to reroll, but player can't add or discard dices when he wants to reroll.
Player can't choose which dice to roll, but he can see which dices are left in the bag and strategize it's roll. By default player can throw 5 dices per roll, but after fourth stake player can throw 6 dices per roll applying modified rules.
